Now, we want to implement a SignalR real-time messaging feature between the creator and the customer so it can be some kind of freelancing hub for special services where the customer who sends a message to the creator will have some kind of security feature that resembles instagram as the first ever message will be as a request to the creator where the creator can accept or decline the message request, and if he accepts, the conversation goes on and they can communicate, there's an option for the customer that he requests a service from the creator to make him something from his own requirement/desire, if the creator accepts that request, he will put a specified deadline for the customer, and if the customer accepts, the creator will finish that task before the deadline, and when he does, he will put it in the message feed as a product that requires purchase with a set price from the customer so that it gets downloaded just like the rest, when the product gets [urchased, it will be in the customer's library like an ordinary purchased product that he purchased from the feed. but won't actually be in the feed, just the library. so how do we do all of this accordingly with everything running intact and no mistakes to be done ?
